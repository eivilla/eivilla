	<p>I will breifly go into detail about some of these hobbies. The hobbies arent ranked or anything they are just what came to my head before the next, But gaming mightve been my least productive hobby if anything i regret spending the amount of time i did playing video games Mr.Staff has never played a video game and i belive he should keep it that way.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Soccer was my longest hobby i had been playing soccer since i could rememebr i broke my arm becuase of soccer i was in a good physical shape and i could run for a long time now im out of breath whenever i go up a flight of stairs. I quit soccer about 4 years ago when i stopped having as much free time, i have so many fond memories of thus sport its a beautiful game.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Gym has been an escape for me its helped so much with my mental health i dont know what i would be doing without it, It also turned me froma a scrawny kid to having muscles i found this hobby a little more than a year ago when i was struggling with my mental health i recommend the gym to all of my friends becuase of how much i have benefited from it </p>
