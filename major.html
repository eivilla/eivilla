	<p> My major is cyber security, This major is about protecting my self or files on the web. I chose this major because computers fascinate me, I love how they work how easy they are to work on. I’ve always liked the idea of hacking unfortunately that isn’t a legal thing to do so I chose the major that does basically the same thing well not really the same thing because we have different goals and intentions but we do the same thing. “War Games” excite me, War Games is a way to test how secure your network as a game there’s different teams some are the attackers and some are the people 
defending against the attackers but that’s just the tip of the iceberg on war games. This semester I look 
forward to getting my Security+ certification from one of my classes, I love attending my networking 
class , I like how I always come out the classroom knowing new things I also love to learn I usually catch 
on pretty quickly. I also enjoy this class but back in high school I had a web development class so I know a few concepts we used to code on Dreamweaver and it made me realize that I like to code.</p>
