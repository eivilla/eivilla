	<p>My Name is Edwin Villa, My full name is Edwin Adany Villa Islas it is kind of long so I 
just go by Edwin Villa its much easier. I was born on august 7th 2003 in Smithfield North Carolina, I think 
just around an hour from Wake Tech South campus. As a kid I loved to play sports I wasn’t the best at 
many of them I enjoyed spending that time running around. At around 5 years old I broke my left arm 
while playing one of those sports, I’m not really sure I want to blame the sport because I was running 
after the soccer ball and I tripped because of a hole In the ground. But did that prevent me from 
continuing to play soccer? Of course not, a kid with the love for the game would not stop that easily. I 
continued to play for another 10 years till I got bored of the game. I still watch It from time to time for 
example the world cup was last month and I watched the greatest of all time win the World Cup trophy 
with a couple of friends from elementary school. When I entered kindergarten I didn’t know much 
English and I some how passed that grade but yet again I learn pretty quick so that could be how or why 
I learned so fast. I recall talking to my kindergarten teacher in English with a cast on while playing soccer 
very fun times I hope she’s doing well</p>
